# BurnBot
A simple AIO fixed response chatbot written in Python. 

**Please note that this script was developed for a course and is not fully representative of my capabilities.**

### The framework:
The script silently pulls down the latest copy from the cloud as you run it, which keeps content fresh and allows for much more dynamic content while interacting with it.

### The response model:
Most Questions are open-ended. All are input validated, and many are stored for future reference **locally**. This program uses subprocess to collect additional context about the user. **All collected and user-generated content is not collected and remains local. But unlike Eufy, my code is OSS.**

### The roast:
Pretty tame tbh. Have fun!
